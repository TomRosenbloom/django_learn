# django_learn
This is me learning Django.

The use-case is a volunteer matching and CRM system for voluntary sector organisations.

There are four classes of user: 

  - Admin (Django superuser login)
  
  - Public (no login) – can browse [and search] directory of organisations [and volunteer roles]
  
  - Volunteer (signup/login as volunteer) – create/edit profile and find matching roles
  
  - Organisation member (signup/login as organisation) – create/edit organisation profile and create roles
